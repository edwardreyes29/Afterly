## Description
Afterly was created to help people that have gone through the lost of a loved oneâ€¦ With that in mind, Afterly has partnered with Yelp to provide curated business information for every step of this process. 

Each form will generate an AJAX call to the YELP API to render the business category and details by the zip code the user-provided (the zip code was submitted when he or she signed up).
When the user selects a particular business, the business details get sent to the database and a new row in the corresponding table is created accordingly.


## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Challenges
Using a combination of Bootstrap and Semantic UI.
