## Technologies

### Frontend:
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, SEMANTIC UI

### Backend:
JavaScript, MySQL, Sequelize, jQuery, Ajax, Express.js, yelp API, yelp-fusion.js, Passport.js, Bycrypt.js

This app uses yelp api to allow us to get all the businesses to display on our app.
We also used yelp-fusion to run the api through node and we created routes using
express to request data instead of requesting data directly from the client side.

## Process

Backend Contributions:

Edward: 
* Configured the passport login to work with our app
* Set up the table templates
* Created User table, Case table, and EstateLaw table
* created yelp functions that incorporate yelp-fusion api calls
* Set up yelp-api-routes, html-routes, and api-table-routes
* Used ajax to make request to routes in order to get data, store data to tables
* Created the logic to send parameters to each page in order to save forms to the current case selected


## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Challenges

* Passing in data to each html page since creating a form relies on having data of the current case. Each case has a zip code and id that is need to return businesses from the zip code and the id is used to create the foreign key for each business table. Our solution was passing in parameters when linking to another html page in order to have the search results reflect the user's zip code. 
* Managing tasks and working around git pull requests.
